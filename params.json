In order to understand how it works, we have to be aware of some concepts.\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n* Actions apply to Resources\r\n* Actions are strings\r\n* Actions can be grouped by action_aliases\r\n\r\n#### Resources\r\n* Resources is simply a name for a thing or group of things (User, Page, UserEditButton, PageTitle)\r\n* Resources are strings\r\n* There is a \"all\" wildcard Resource predefined (handy for admins)\r\n\r\n#### Rules\r\n* A Rule is a way to allow or deny a User to perform an Action on a Resource\r\n* A Rule contains 1 Action, 1 Resource and optionally a Closure (internal logic)\r\n* Rules will be initialized once per page load (only when being called) for the user that does the request\r\n\r\n#### Allow\r\n* Allow applies a Rule to a User, that allows the user to perform an Action on a Resource\r\n* If the Rule contains a Closure, the User will only be allowed to perform the Action when the Closure returns \"true\"\r\n\r\n#### Deny\r\n* Deny applies a Rule to a user, that denies the user to perform an Action on a Resource\r\n* If the Rule contains a Closure, the User will only be denied from performing the Action when the Closure returns \"true\"\r\n\r\nNow that we are familiar with these concepts, let's dive into some example configurations.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t'initialize' => function($user)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// The initialize method (this Closure function) will be ran on every page load when the bundle get's started.\r\n\t\t// A User Object will be passed into this method and is available via $user\r\n\t\t// The $user variable is a instantiated User Object (application/models/user.php)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// First, let's group together some \"Actions\" so we can later give a User access to multiple actions at once\r\n\t\tAuthority::action_alias('manage', array('create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'));\r\n\t\tAuthority::action_alias('moderate', array('update', 'delete'));\r\n\r\n\t\t// If a user doesn't have any roles, we don't have to give him permissions so we can stop right here.\r\n\t\tif(count($user->roles) == 0) return false;\r\n\r\n\t\t// Let's say we want to \"Deny\" the User from adding accounts if his age is below 21 (i don't mean to discriminate ;) \r\n\t\t// Since we have the User object, and it has an \"age\" property, we can make a simple if statement.\r\n\t\tif($user->age < 21)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t// Too young! we \"deny\" the user to create users, i'm sorry...\r\n\t\t\tAuthority::deny('create', 'User');\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tif($user->has_role('admin'))\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t// The logged in user is an admin, we allow him to perform manage actions (create, read, update, delete) on \"all\" \"Resources\".\r\n\t\t\tAuthority::allow('manage', 'all');\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t// Let's make it a little harder, we don't want the admin to be able to delete his own User account, but has to be allowed to delete other Users.\r\n\t\t\t// We only know that the \"Resource\" is a User, But we don't know the User id, we can send that information to the Rule Closure, in the Closure below, the argument is called $that_user.\r\n\t\t\t// We also pass in the logged in user, since the Closure is outside of the scope where this comment is in.\r\n\t\t\tAuthority::deny('delete', 'User', function ($that_user) use ($user)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t// If the id of the User that we are trying to delete is equal to our logged in user, we return true, meaning the Deny Rule will be set.\r\n\t\t\t\treturn $that_user->id == $user->id;\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tif($user->has_role('store_owner'))\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t// What if the logged in User has the role \"store_owner\", let's allow the user to manage his own store\r\n\t\t\tAuthority::allow('manage', 'Store', function($store) use ($user)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\treturn ! is_null(DB::table('stores')->where_id($store->id)->where_user_id($user->id)->first());\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// We can set Allow and Deny Rules by looping through results we get from somewhere else, in this example, a database\r\n\t\tforeach(DB::table('rules')->where_user_id($user->id)->get() as $permission)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tif($permission->type == 'allow')\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tAuthority::allow($permission->action, $permission->resource);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\telse\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tAuthority::deny($permission->action, $permission->resource);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that we have the initialize method setup, we can do checks throughout our code (controllers/models/views) like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t// in some controller\r\n\tif(Authority::cannot('create', 'User'))\r\n\t{\r\n\t    Redirect::to('home');\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// in some view\r\n\t<?php if(Authority::can('edit', 'User')): ?>\r\n\t\t<?php echo HTML::link('users/edit/'.$user->id, 'Edit User'); ?>\r\n\t<?php endif ?>\r\n\r\n\t// In some model\r\n\t$user = User::find($id);\r\n\tif(Authority::can('delete', 'User', $user))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t$user->delete();\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Authority?
